# PSO-Fed: Partial Sharing Online Federated Learning

This repository implements a communication-efficient online federated learning framework for nonlinear regression using partial sharing. Clients update local models with streaming data and share only portions of those updates with the server, reducing communication overhead while maintaining performance.

This implementation is inspired by the work of Vinay Chakravarthi Gogineni et al., titled "Communication-Efficient Online Federated Learning Framework for Nonlinear Regression," presented at International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing 2022. [Read the paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP43922.2022.9746228).

## Project Structure

The project is divided into four main scripts:

### 1. `dataset_generator.py`
   - **Purpose**: Contains the `DatasetGenerator` class, responsible for generating synthetic data for federated learning. It uses random Fourier features (RFF) to map each clientâ€™s input-output data and generates corresponding labels.
   - **Key Functionality**:
       - `generate_dataset()`: Produces input-output pairs for each client using random Fourier features and an autoregressive model to generate inputs.

### 2. `federated_learning.py`
   - **Purpose**: Contains the `FederatedLearning` class, which performs local updates for each client and applies federated averaging to update the global model.
   - **Key Functionality**:
      - `client_update()`: Updates the local models by computing gradients on each client's data and adjusting the model weights accordingly.
      - `federated_averaging()`: Aggregates the local models from selected clients to compute the global model using federated averaging.
      - `evaluate_global_model()`: Evaluates the performance of the global model across clients by calculating mean squared error (MSE).
      - `print_final_global_model()`: Displays the final global model weights at the end of training.

### 3. `experiment_runner.py`
   - **Purpose**: Contains the `ExperimentRunner` class, which manages the execution of federated learning experiments by integrating dataset generation and local model updates.
   - **Key Functionality**:
      - `run()`: Executes multiple experiments, generates training and testing datasets, conducts federated learning rounds, and tracks global loss histories across experiments.

### 4. `main.py`
   - **Purpose**: The entry point of the project, responsible for initializing and running the federated learning experiments using the `ExperimentRunner` class.
   - **Key Functionality**:
      - `main()`: Sets up the parameters for the experiment, calls the `ExperimentRunner`, and runs the entire training and evaluation process.

## Installation
